# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This is my take on the password generator starter code. I added functionality we learned about in class so that when the user presses the red button, it will prompt them for a password length and what types of characters they want to include in their password. From there, it will print the generated password in the text box.

The main branch is what I used to deploy the application. The branch passwort_v1.0 was used for making changes and experimenting. The branch passwort_v1.0_withComments contains an older form of v1.0 where I was figuring out how various pieces of code we learned about in class worked together to create the desired functionality for this homework. I cannot guarantee the functionality of anything loaded in any branch that is not the main branch, as the main branch is the most up to date.

## Credits

I ran into a few issues with parts of my code being in the wrong order to achieve the desired functionality. Some issues I was able to puzzle out through trial and error, while for others I consulted ChatGPT to explain to me what was wrong in a section of my code and how to fix it to achieve the desired effect.
